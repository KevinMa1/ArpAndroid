### Info - About
An app for android 4.1+ that protects your smartphone from an arp attack, by setting a static ip on the ARP table. Also has the ability to to spoof arp and make a MiTM attack. It's started as a main project for the course of "Mobile and Wireless Networks Security" at the Department of Information & Communication Systems Engineering, University of Aegean. App requires root access to work so keep in mind! Anyway you shouldn't expect anything fancy lads. :bowtie: Also the project build with Android Studio IDE, if you want to you can import it to eclipse (needs to be converted).
